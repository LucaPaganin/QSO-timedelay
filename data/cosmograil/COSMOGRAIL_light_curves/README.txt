README : 

All the public light curves of lensed quasars monitored by COSMOGRAIL are gathered in this folder. 
The tables containing all the photometric data after deconvolution are given in .rdb files, which you can simply open with a text editor. 
The tables contains the following columns : 

mhjd : Date of observation (Modified Julian Day)
mag_X : Relative magnitude of image X (mag). No zero-point correction have been applied. 
mag_X_err : Photometric error of image X (mag)
telescope (optionnal) : instrument used for the observation (this column is present only when data from several instrument have been merged into one single lightcurve).
