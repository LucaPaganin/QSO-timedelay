	abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant (H0) and other cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of six gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays. All lenses except the first are analyzed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find {\$}H{\_}{\{}0{\}} = 73.3{\_}{\{}-1.8{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+1.7{\}}{\~{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}km{\~{}}s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\~{}}Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\}}{\$}, a {\$}2.4{\{}{\{}\backslash \backslashrm per\backslash cent{\}}{\}}{\$} precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of H0 from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in 3.1$\sigma$ tension with Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in 5.3$\sigma$ tension with Planck CMB determinations of H0 in flat $\Lambda$CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat $\Lambda$CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with Planck. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our H0 inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on H0 ranges from ∼73–78 km s−1 Mpc−1, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

	abstract = {We present the results of 15 years of monitoring of lensed quasars conducted by the COSMOGRAIL program at the Leonhard Euler 1.2m Swiss Telescope. The decade-lo\
	ng light curves of 23 lensed QSOs are presented for the first time. We complement our data set with other monitoring data available in the literature to measure the time delays in \
	18 systems, among which 9 reach a relative precision better than 15{\%} for at least one time delay. To achieve this, we develop an automated version of the curve-shifting toolbox \
	PyCS to ensure robust estimation of the time delay in the presence of microlensing while accounting for the errors due to imperfect representation of microlensing. We also reanalyz\
	e the previously published time delays of RX J1131{\$}-{\$}1231 and HE 0435{\$}-{\$}1223, adding respectively 6 and 2 new seasons of monitoring and confirming the previous time-del\
	ay measurements. When the time delay measurement is possible, we correct the light curves of the lensed images from their time delay and present the difference curves to highlight \
	the microlensing signal contained in the data. This is to date the largest sample of decade-long lens monitoring data, useful to measure {\$}H{\_}0{\$}, to measure the size of quas\

@article{Bonvin2016a,
	abstract = {COSMOGRAIL is a long-term photometric monitoring of gravitationally lensed quasars aimed at implementing Refsdal's time-delay method to measure cosmological par\
	ameters, in particular H0. Given the long and well sampled light curves of strongly lensed quasars, time-delay measurements require numerical techniques whose quality must be asses\
	sed. To this end, and also in view of future monitoring programs or surveys such as the LSST, a blind signal processing competition named Time Delay Challenge 1 (TDC1) was held in \
	2014. The aim of the present paper, which is based on the simulated light curves from the TDC1, is double. First, we test the performance of the time-delay measurement techniques c\
	urrently used in COSMOGRAIL. Second, we analyse the quantity and quality of the harvest of time delays obtained from the TDC1 simulations. To achieve these goals, we first discover\
	time delays through a careful inspection of the light curves via a dedicated visual interface. Our measurement algorithms can then be applied to the data in an automated way. We s\
	how that our techniques have no significant biases, and yield adequate uncertainty estimates resulting in reduced $\chi$2 values between 0.5 and 1.0. We provide estimates for the n\
	umber and precision of time-delay measurements that can be expected from future time-delay monitoring campaigns as a function of the photometric signal-to-noise ratio and of the tr\
	ue time delay. We make our blind measurements on the TDC1 data publicly available.},
