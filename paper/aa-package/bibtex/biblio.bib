@article{Bonvin2016a,
abstract = {COSMOGRAIL is a long-term photometric monitoring of gravitationally lensed quasars aimed at implementing Refsdal's time-delay method to measure cosmological parameters, in particular H0. Given the long and well sampled light curves of strongly lensed quasars, time-delay measurements require numerical techniques whose quality must be assessed. To this end, and also in view of future monitoring programs or surveys such as the LSST, a blind signal processing competition named Time Delay Challenge 1 (TDC1) was held in 2014. The aim of the present paper, which is based on the simulated light curves from the TDC1, is double. First, we test the performance of the time-delay measurement techniques currently used in COSMOGRAIL. Second, we analyse the quantity and quality of the harvest of time delays obtained from the TDC1 simulations. To achieve these goals, we first discover time delays through a careful inspection of the light curves via a dedicated visual interface. Our measurement algorithms can then be applied to the data in an automated way. We show that our techniques have no significant biases, and yield adequate uncertainty estimates resulting in reduced $\chi$2 values between 0.5 and 1.0. We provide estimates for the number and precision of time-delay measurements that can be expected from future time-delay monitoring campaigns as a function of the photometric signal-to-noise ratio and of the true time delay. We make our blind measurements on the TDC1 data publicly available.},

abstract = {Measuring time delays between the multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars is now recognized as a competitive way to constrain the cosmological parameters, and it is complementary with other cosmological probes. This requires long and well sampled optical light curves of numerous lensed quasars, such as those obtained by the COSMOGRAIL collaboration. High-quality data from our monitoring campaign call for novel numerical techniques to robustly measure the delays, as well as the associated random and systematic uncertainties, even in the presence of microlensing variations. We propose three different point estimators to measure time delays, which are explicitly designed to handle light curves with extrinsic variability. These methods share a common formalism, which enables them to process data from n-image lenses. Since the estimators rely on significantly contrasting ideas, we expect them to be sensitive to different bias sources. For each method and data set, we empirically estimate both the precision and accuracy (bias) of the time delay measurement using simulated light curves with known time delays that closely mimic the observations. Finally, we test the self-consistency of our approach, and we demonstrate that our bias estimation is serviceable. These new methods, including the empirical uncertainty estimator, will represent the standard benchmark for analyzing the COSMOGRAIL light curves. {\textcopyright} 2013 ESO.},

abstract = {We present a new measurement of the Hubble Constant H0 and other cosmological parameters based on the joint analysis of three multiply imaged quasar systems with measured gravitational time delays. First, we measure the time delay of HE 0435-1223 from 13-yr light curves obtained as part of the COSMOGRAIL project. Companion papers detail the modelling of the main deflectors and line-of-sight effects, and how these data are combined to determine the time-delay distance of HE 0435-1223. Crucially, the measurements are carried out blindly with respect to cosmological parameters in order to avoid confirmation bias. We then combine the time-delay distance of HE 0435-1223 with previous measurements from systems B1608+656 and RXJ1131-1231 to create a Time Delay Strong Lensing probe (TDSL). In flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) with free matter and energy density, we find H0 = 71.9-3.0+2.4 km s-1 Mpc-1 and $\Omega$$\Lambda$ = 0.62-0.35+0.24. This measurement is completely independent of, and in agreement with, the local distance ladder measurements of H0. We explore more general cosmological models combining TDSL with other probes, illustrating its power to break degeneracies inherent to other methods. The joint constraints from TDSL and Planck are H0 = 69.2-2.2+1.4 km s-1 Mpc-1, $\Omega$$\Lambda$ = 0.70-0.01+0.01 and $\Omega$k = 0.003-0.006+0.004 in open $\Lambda$CDM and H0 = 79.0-4.2+4.4 km s-1 Mpc-1, $\Omega$de = 0.77-0.03+0.02 and w = -1.38-0.16+0.14 in flat wCDM. In combination with Planck and baryon acoustic oscillation data, when relaxing the constraints on the numbers of relativistic species we find Neff = 3.34-0.21+0.21 in Neff$\Lambda$CDM and when relaxing the total mass of neutrinos we find ∑m$\nu$ =0.182 eV in m$\nu$$\lambda$CDM. Finally, in an open wCDM in combination with Planck and cosmic microwave background lensing, we find H0 = 77.9-4.2+5.0 km s-1 Mpc-1, $\Omega$de = 0.77-0.03+0.03, $\Omega$k = -0.003-0.004+0.004 and w = -1.37-0.23+0.18.},

abstract = {Strong gravitational lenses with measured time delays between the multiple images allow a direct measurement of the time-delay distance to the lens, and thus a measure of cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant, H0. We present a blind lens model analysis of the quadruply imaged quasar lens HE 0435-1223 using deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging, updated time-delay measurements from the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses (COSMOGRAIL), a measurement of the velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy based on Keck data, and a characterization of the mass distribution along the line of sight. HE 0435-1223 is the third lens analysed as a part of the H0 Lenses in COSMOGRAIL's Wellspring (H0LiCOW) project. We account for various sources of systematic uncertainty, including the detailed treatment of nearby perturbers, the parametrization of the galaxy light and mass profile, and the regions used for lens modelling. We constrain the effective timedelay distance to be D$\Delta$t = 2612+208-191 Mpc, a precision of 7.6 per cent. From HE 0435-1223 alone, we infer a Hubble constant of H0 = 73.1+5.7-6.0 km s-1 Mpc-1 assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

It is concluded from the application of this method to published data that previous estimates based on optical data of the time delay between components A and B of the gravitational lens 0957 + 561 are incorrect: their quoted error bars are vastly underestimated. The method is extended and applied to the radio data of Lehar et al. (1992). For the radio data alone, the analysis yields the result tau-AB = 548 +19/-16 d.

Using simulated quasar light curves, we demonstrate that in a survey that observes objects several times each lunar cycle over the course of five years it is possible, through the use of time delay selection, to significantly improve the efficiency of a gravitational lens search relative to that of an equivalent search that does not take advantage of time delay information. We show that window function effects associated with the length of the observing season are more important than the total number of data points in determining the effectiveness of this method. We also qualitatively discuss several complications that might be relevant to a real-time delay search.},

This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in 5.3$\sigma$ tension with Planck CMB determinations of H0 in flat $\Lambda$CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat $\Lambda$CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with Planck. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our H0 inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on H0 ranges from ∼73–78 km s−1 Mpc−1, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

abstract = {We quantify quasar color variability using an unprecedented variability database-ugriz photometry of 9093 quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82, observed over 8 years at ∼60 epochs each. We confirm previous reports that quasars become bluer when brightening. We find a redshift dependence of this blueing in a given set of bands (e.g., g and r), but show that it is the result of the flux contribution from less-variable or delayed emission lines in the different SDSS bands at different redshifts. After correcting for this effect, quasar color variability is remarkably uniform, and independent not only of redshift, but also of quasar luminosity and black hole mass. The color variations of individual quasars, as they vary in brightness on year timescales, are much more pronounced than the ranges in color seen in samples of quasars across many orders of magnitude in luminosity. This indicates distinct physical mechanisms behind quasar variability and the observed range of quasar luminosities at a given black hole mass - quasar variations cannot be explained by changes in the mean accretion rate. We do find some dependence of the color variability on the characteristics of the flux variations themselves, with fast, low-amplitude, brightness variations producing more color variability. The observed behavior could arise if quasar variability results from flares or ephemeral hot spots in an accretion disk. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

To achieve this, we develop an automated version of the curve-shifting toolbox PyCS to ensure robust estimation of the time delay in the presence of microlensing while accounting for the errors due to imperfect representation of microlensing. We also reanalyze the previously published time delays of RX J1131{\$}-{\$}1231 and HE 0435{\$}-{\$}1223, adding respectively 6 and 2 new seasons of monitoring and confirming the previous time-delay measurements. When the time delay measurement is possible, we correct the light curves of the lensed images from their time delay and present the difference curves to highlight the microlensing signal contained in the data. This is to date the largest sample of decade-long lens monitoring data, useful to measure {\$}H{\_}0{\$}, to measure the size of quasar accretion disks with microlensing, and to study quasar variability.},

abstract = {We present accurate time delays for the quadruply imaged quasar HE 0435-1223. The delays were measured from 575 independent photometric points obtained in the R-band between January 2004 and March 2010. With seven years of data, we clearly show that quasar image A is affected by strong microlensing variations and that the time delays are best expressed relative to quasar image B. We measured $\Delta$tBC = 7.8 ± 0.8 days, $\Delta$t BD =-6.5 ± 0.7 days and $\Delta$tCD =-14.3 ± 0.8 days. We spacially deconvolved HST NICMOS2 F160W images to derive accurate astrometry of the quasar images and to infer the light profile of the lensing galaxy. We combined these images with a stellar population fitting of a deep VLT spectrum of the lensing galaxy to estimate the baryonic fraction, f b, in the Einstein radius. We measured fb = 0.65 -0.10+0.13 if the lensing galaxy has a Salpeter IMF and fb = 0.45-0.07+0.04 if it has a Kroupa IMF. The spectrum also allowed us to estimate the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, $\sigma$ap = 222 ± 34 km s-1. We used f b and $\sigma$ap to constrain an analytical model of the lensing galaxy composed of an Hernquist plus generalized NFW profile. We solved the Jeans equations numerically for the model and explored the parameter space under the additional requirement that the model must predict the correct astrometry for the quasar images. Given the current error bars on fb and $\sigma$ap, we did not constrain H0 yet with high accuracy, i.e., we found a broad range of models with $\chi$2 {\textless} 1. However, narrowing this range is possible, provided a better velocity dispersion measurement becomes available. In addition, increasing the depth of the current HST imaging data of HE 0435-1223 will allow us to combine ourconstraints with lens reconstruction techniques that make use of the full Einstein ring that is visible in this object. {\textcopyright} 2011 ESO.},

abstract = {We conduct a pilot investigation to determine the optimal combination of color and variability information to identify quasars in current and future multi-epoch optical surveys. We use a Bayesian quasar selection algorithm to identify 35,820 type 1 quasar candidates in a 239 deg2 field of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82, using a combination of optical photometry and variability. Color analysis is performed on 5-band single- and multi-epoch SDSS optical photometry to a depth of r ∼ 22.4. From these data, variability parameters are calculated by fitting the structure function of each object in each band with a power-law model using 10 to{\textgreater}100 observations over timescales from ∼1 day to ∼8 years. Selection was based on a training sample of 13,221 spectroscopically confirmed type-1 quasars, largely from the SDSS. Using variability alone, colors alone, and combining variability and colors we achieve 91{\%}, 93{\%}, and 97{\%} quasar completeness and 98{\%}, 98{\%}, and 97{\%} efficiency, respectively, with particular improvement in the selection of quasars at 2.7 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5 where quasars and stars have similar optical colors. The 22,867 quasar candidates that are not spectroscopically confirmed reach a depth of i ∼ 22.0; 21,876 (95.7{\%}) are dimmer than coadded i-band magnitude of 19.9, the cutoff for spectroscopic follow-up for SDSS on Stripe 82. Brighter than 19.9, we find 5.7{\%} more quasar candidates without confirming spectra in sky regions otherwise considered complete. The resulting quasar sample has sufficient purity (and statistically correctable incompleteness) to produce a luminosity function comparable to those determined by spectroscopic investigations. We discuss improvements that can be made to the process in preparation for performing similar photometric selection and science on data from post-SDSS sky surveys.},

abstract = {Based on spectroscopy and multiband wide-field observations of the gravitationally lensed quasar HE 0435-1223, we determine the probability distribution function of the external convergence $\kappa$ext for this system. We measure the under/overdensity of the line of sight towards the lens system and compare it to the average line of sight throughout the Universe, determined by using the CFHTLenS (The Canada France Hawaii Lensing Survey) as a control field. Aiming to constrain $\kappa$ext as tightly as possible, we determine under/overdensities using various combinations of relevant informative weighting schemes for the galaxy counts, such as projected distance to the lens, redshift and stellar mass. We then convert the measured under/overdensities into a $\kappa$ext distribution, using ray-tracing through the Millennium Simulation. We explore several limiting magnitudes and apertures, and account for systematic and statistical uncertainties relevant to the quality of the observational data, which we further test through simulations. Our most robust estimate of $\kappa$ext has a median value $\kappa$ extmed = 0.004 and a standard deviation $\sigma$$\kappa$ = 0.025. The measured $\sigma$$\kappa$ corresponds to 2.5 per cent relative uncertainty on the time delay distance, and hence the Hubble constant H0 inferred from this system. The median $\kappa$ extmed value varies by {\~{}}0.005 with the adopted aperture radius, limiting magnitude and weighting scheme, as long as the latter incorporates galaxy number counts, the projected distance to the main lens and a prior on the external shear obtained from mass modelling. This corresponds to just {\~{}}0.5 per cent systematic impact on H0. The availability of a well-constrained $\kappa$ext makes HE 0435-1223 a valuable system for measuring cosmological parameters using strong gravitational lens time delays.},

abstract = {Galaxies located in the environment or along the line of sight towards gravitational lenses can significantly affect lensing observables, and can lead to systematic errors on the measurement of H0 from the time-delay technique. We present the results of a systematic spectroscopic identification of the galaxies in the field of view of the lensed quasar HE 0435-1223 using the W. M. Keck, Gemini and ESO-Very Large telescopes. Our new catalogue triples the number of known galaxy redshifts in the direct vicinity of the lens, expanding to 102 the number of measured redshifts for galaxies separated by less than 3 arcmin from the lens.We complement our catalogue with literature data to gather redshifts up to 15 arcmin from the lens, and search for galaxy groups or clusters projected towards HE 0435-1223. We confirm that the lens is a member of a small group that includes at least 12 galaxies, and find 8 other group candidates near the line of sight of the lens. The flexion shift, namely the shift of lensed images produced by high-order perturbation of the lens potential, is calculated for each galaxy/group and used to identify which objects produce the largest perturbation of the lens potential. This analysis demonstrates that (i) at most three of the five brightest galaxies projected within 12 arcsec of the lens need to be explicitly used in the lens models, and (ii) the groups can be treated in the lens model as an external tidal field (shear) contribution.},

abstract = {Aims. The study of the ensemble properties of the UV/optical broadband variability of quasars is hampered by the combined effects of the dependence of variability on timescale, rest-frame wavelength, and luminosity. Here, we present a new approach to analysing the dependence of quasar variability on rest-frame wavelengths. Methods. We exploited the spectral archive of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to create a sample of over 9000 quasars in the Stripe 82. The quasar catalogue was matched with the Light Motion Curve Catalogue for SDSS Stripe 82 and first-order structure functions were computed from the lightcurves. The structure functions are used to create a variability indicator that is related to the same intrinsic timescales for all quasars (about 1 to 2 yr in the rest-frame). We study the variability ratios for adjacent SDSS filter bands as a function of redshift. A quantitative interpretation of these relations is provided by comparing with the results of simple Monte Carlo simulations of variable quasar spectra. Results. We confirm the well-known dependence of variability on time-lag; the best power-law fit of the sample-averaged structure function has a slope $\beta$ = 0.31 ± 0.03. We also confirm that anti-correlations exist with luminosity, wavelength, and redshift, where the latter can be fully explained as a consequence of the former two dependencies. The variability ratios as a function of redshift resemble the corresponding colour index-redshift relations. While variability is almost always stronger in the bluer passband than in the redder, the variability ratio depends on whether strong emission lines contribute to either one band or the other. We find that the observed variability ratio-redshift relations are described well assuming that (a) the r.m.s. fluctuation of the quasar continuum flux follows a power law $\sigma$(f$\lambda$) $\theta$$\lambda$ -2 (i.e., is bluer when brighter) and (b) the variability of the emission line flux is only ∼10{\%} of that of the underlying continuum. These results, based upon the photometry of more than 8000 quasars, confirm the previous findings by Wilhite and collaborators for 315 quasars with repeated SDSS spectroscopy. Finally, we find that quasars with unusual spectra and weak emission lines tend to have less variability than conventional quasars. This trend is the opposite of that expected from the dilution effect of variability due to line emission and may be indicative of high Eddington ratios in these unusual quasars. {\textcopyright} 2010 ESO.},

Light curves from the images of gravitationally lensed quasars are further affected by superimposed variability due to microlensing. In order to disentangle the microlensing from the intrinsic variability of the light curves, the time delays between the multiple images have to be accurately measured.

In this paper we present the most extensive and coherent collection of simulated microlensing light curves; we have generated {\textless}2.5 billion light curves using the GERLUMPH high resolution microlensing magnification maps. Our simulations can be used to train algorithms to measure lensed quasar time delays, plan future monitoring campaigns, and study light curve properties throughout parameter space.

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of "dark energy" with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit "Stage IV" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Our result is made possible by implementing a new observational strategy using almost daily observations with the MPIA 2.2m telescope at La Silla observatory and deep exposures reaching a signal-to-noise ratio of about 1000 per quasar image. This data quality allows us to catch small photometric variations (a few mmag rms) of the quasar, acting on temporal scales much shorter than microlensing, hence making the time delay measurement very robust against microlensing. In only 7 months we measure very accurately one of the time delays in DES J0408-5354: Dt(AB) = -112.1 +- 2.1 days (1.8{\%}) using only the MPIA 2.2m data. In combination with data taken with the 1.2m Euler Swiss telescope, we also measure two delays involving the D component of the system Dt(AD) = -155.5 +- 12.8 days (8.2{\%}) and Dt(BD) = -42.4 +- 17.6 days (41{\%}), where all the error bars include systematics.

In cosmological models with one-parameter extension to flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter, we expect to measure H0 to {\textless} 3.5 per cent in most models, spatial curvature $\Omega$k to 0.004, w to 0.14 and the effective number of neutrino species to 0.2 (1$\sigma$ uncertainties) when combined with current cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. These are, respectively, a factor of {\~{}}15, {\~{}}2 and {\~{}}1.5 tighter than CMB alone. Our data set will further enable us to study the stellar initial mass function of the lens galaxies, and the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. This program will provide a foundation for extracting cosmological distances from the hundreds of time-delay lenses that are expected to be discovered in current and future surveys.},

@article{Dobler2015,
abstract = {The time delays between point-like images in gravitational lens systems can be used to measure cosmological parameters. The number of lenses with measured time delays is growing rapidly; the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will monitor 103 strongly lensed quasars. In an effort to assess the present capabilities of the community, to accurately measure the time delays, and to provide input to dedicated monitoring campaigns and future LSST cosmology feasibility studies, we have invited the community to take part in a "Time Delay Challenge" (TDC). The challenge is organized as a set of "ladders," each containing a group of simulated data sets to be analyzed blindly by participating teams. Each rung on a ladder consists of a set of realistic mock observed lensed quasar light curves, with the rungs' data sets increasing in complexity and realism. The initial challenge described here has two ladders, TDC0 and TDC1. TDC0 has a small number of data sets, and is designed to be used as a practice set by the participating teams. The (non-mandatory) deadline for completion of TDC0 was the TDC1 launch date, 2013 December 1. The TDC1 deadline was 2014 July 1. Here we give an overview of the challenge, we introduce a set of metrics that will be used to quantify the goodness of fit, efficiency, precision, and accuracy of the algorithms, and we present the results of TDC0. Thirteen teams participated in TDC0 using 47 different methods. Seven of those teams qualified for TDC1, which is described in the companion paper.},

abstract = {Restricted Boltzmann machines were developed using binary stochastic hidden units. These can be generalized by replacing each binary unit by an infinite number of copies that all have the same weights but have progressively more negative biases. The learning and inference rules for these "Stepped Sigmoid Units" are unchanged. They can be approximated efficiently by noisy, rectified linear units. Compared with binary units, these units learn features that are better for object recognition on the NORB dataset and face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. Unlike binary units, rectified linear units preserve information about relative intensities as information travels through multiple layers of feature detectors.},
